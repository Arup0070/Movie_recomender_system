# Movie Recommendation System
Welcome to our Movie Recommendation System! This system utilizes sklearn's Count Vectorizer for word embedding, NLTK's Porter Stemmer for word stemming, and sklearn's cosine_similarity for finding similar movies. MongoDB Atlas Cloud is used for data storage, and Docker is employed for containerization. The application is deployed on Google Cloud Run platform. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project successfully.
